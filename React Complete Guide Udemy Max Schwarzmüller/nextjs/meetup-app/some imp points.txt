* Jasie filename dynamic kiya tha for a dynamic page, wasie hi folder name bhi dynamic kar sakte he, using the same syntax of [].

* IMP - Nextjs project ka jo ROOT COMPONENT hota he wo _app.js wali file mai hota he. Is root component ko 2 special props milte he by Nextjs -
1. Component -> contains the parent component (returned JSX) of the page that is to be rendered, so, this will change from page to page.
2. pageProps -> contains the props that are being passed to the component of a page that is to be rendered, so, this will change from page to page aswell.
-> So, the COMMON COMPONENTS to all the pages ie Navbar, Footer etc can be inserted in the ROOT Component, and then they will reflect on all the pages.


* Programmatic Navigation in Nextjs -
-> called Imperative Naviagtion.
-> useRouter hook ki madad se hota he.
-> jo router object milta he useRouter se usmai .push() method hota he -> pushes a page onto the pages stack, then takes us to that URL.

* A good practice is to NOT have css files in the pages folder. Keep it only for route js files.

* There are 2 types of page pre-rendering that we can do using Nextjs -
1. Static Generation
2. Server-side rendering
-> The difference between the 2 is that the code runs at different point of times. 

1. Static Generation - Ismai mai pages pre-render / pre-generate karta hu PRODUCTION BUILD banate waqt. To agr ek baar production build ban gai to wo pre-rendered pages change ni honge, change karne ke liye build firse karna padega.
