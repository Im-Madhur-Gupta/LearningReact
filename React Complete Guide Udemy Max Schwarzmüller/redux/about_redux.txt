* Redux is a state management system to manage cross-component OR app-wide state.

* React Context aur Redux same work karte he.

* React context performs fine for {low-frequency updating states} but for {high-frequency} ones it's not good, in the 2nd case we should use Redux.
    App-wide state mai low-freq updates he -> React Context.
    App-wide state mai high-freq updates he -> Redux.

* Redux is not just limited to React, it can be used in any JS (or other language) projects.

* class based components mai Redux ka usage - video 237 Maximillian Course.

* Kisi bade application mai agr mai redux ka use kar raha hu to -
1. action object ke "type" fields mismatch ho sakte he.
2. State object bhi bada ho jaega bade projects mai.
3. Aur mujhe ye bhi dhyan mai rakhna he ki reducer function mai mai brand new object return karu prevState ko galti se bhi mutate na karu.

-> In problems ko solve karne ke liye we use redux toolkit.
