* Redux is a state management system to manage cross-component OR app-wide state.

* React Context aur Redux same work karte he.

* React context performs fine for {low-frequency updating states} but for {high-frequency} ones it's not good, in the 2nd case we should use Redux.
    App-wide state mai low-freq updates he -> React Context.
    App-wide state mai high-freq updates he -> Redux.

* Redux is not just limited to React, it can be used in any JS (or other language) projects.
